## [Project 1: Bodyfat Estimation](https://github.com/zli995/Bodyfat-Estimation) 
- Performed the whole data analytics workflow, including data loading, data exploring, model selection, data visualization, and problem solving with R.
- Built a model which provides accurate estimation of menâ€™s bodyfat with only requiring 4 input values for prediction.
- Achieved user-interface by creating a [Shiny application](https://lofia.shinyapps.io/628_hw2/) that run our bodyfat calculator in real-time.
